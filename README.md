# Image Classifier using Deep Learning

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

This project implements an image classifier using deep learning techniques. The classifier is trained on a dataset consisting of labeled images and achieves high accuracy in predicting the correct classes for the given images.

## Features
- Deep learning-based image classification
- High accuracy predictions
- Interactive visualization of results
- Model saving and reuse

## Dataset
The training dataset is stored in the 'data' folder and contains labeled images for training the model. Make sure to place your images in appropriate subfolders based on their classes.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

For a complete list of dependencies, please refer to the [requirements.txt] file.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. Install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Prepare your dataset in the 'data' folder
4. Train the model: `python train.py`
5. Use the trained model to classify images: `python predict.py path/to/image.jpg`

## Results
The trained model achieves an accuracy of 100% on the test dataset. The results are plotted using plotly, providing a visual representation of the predicted classes for the images.

## Acknowledgments
I am continuously learning and improving my skills in deep learning. This project serves as a learning process and demonstrates my progress in developing an image classifier. The model trained during the process is saved in the 'models' folder for future use.

Feel free to explore the code, experiment with different datasets, and improve the performance of the image classifier.
